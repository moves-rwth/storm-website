## Rapid prototyping with stormpy

If you want to develop with Storm or implement your own algorithms on top of Storm, using the Python bindings [stormpy](https://moves-rwth.github.io/stormpy/) can be a good starting point for rapid prototyping.

## Developing with C++ interface

If performance or access to low-level implementations is important for you, you can directly integrate with the C++ interface of Storm.

We prepared an [example repository](https://github.com/moves-rwth/storm-project-starter-cpp) that easily allows you to create your own C++ project with access to the efficient data structures and algorithms of Storm.

We provide some general developer information in the [Storm repository](https://github.com/moves-rwth/storm/blob/master/doc/developers.md).

The Doxygen documentation generated from Storm's source code can be found [here](https://moves-rwth.github.io/storm-doc/).
