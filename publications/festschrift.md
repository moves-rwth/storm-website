On this page, you can find supplementary material for the paper "[Riding the Storm in a Probabilistic Model Checking Landscape](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-75775-4_5)".

For each example, we provide Jupyter notebooks which contain the model(s) and the corresponding analysis.
All notebooks are available in the [stormpyter](https://github.com/moves-rwth/stormpyter) repository in the directory [festschrift_storm](https://github.com/moves-rwth/stormpyter/tree/master/festschrift_storm).
We refer to the [README](https://github.com/moves-rwth/stormpyter/blob/master/festschrift_storm/README.md) for instructions on how to run the Juypter notebooks with Docker.
