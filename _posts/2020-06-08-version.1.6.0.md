We are happy to announce the next stable releases of Storm and stormpy in version 1.6.0.
<!--more-->

The new release of Storm uses [Sylvan](https://trolando.github.io/sylvan/){:target="_blank"} as the default Dd library and features a new export of schedulers in a `.json` format.
In addition, the support for POMDPs in `storm-pomdp` was improved and extended significantly.

The Python bindings [stormpy](https://moves-rwth.github.io/stormpy/) are also released in a new version which is compatible with the new Storm release.
Stormpy now supports GSPNs, in particular building, parsing and exploring them.
In addition, the new release offers bindings for building the transition matrix and state valuations.

For detailed information on all the changes, please check the [release notes of Storm](https://github.com/moves-rwth/storm/releases/tag/1.6.0) and the [release notes of stormpy](https://github.com/moves-rwth/stormpy/releases).
